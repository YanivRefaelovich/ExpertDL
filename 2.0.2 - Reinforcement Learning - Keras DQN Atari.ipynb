    "## Deep Q-networks\n",
    "\n",
    "While our ordinary Q-network was able to barely perform as well as the Q-Table in a simple game environment, Deep $Q$-Networks are much more capable. In order to transform an ordinary Q-Network into a DQN we will be making the following improvements:\n",
    "+ Going from a single-layer network to a multi-layer convolutional network.\n",
    "+ Implementing Experience Replay, which will allow our network to train itself using stored memories from it’s experience.\n",
    "+ Utilizing a second “target” network, which we will use to compute target $Q$-values during our updates.\n",

    "### Convolutional Layers\n",
    "\n",
    "Since our agent is going to be learning to play video games, it has to be able to make sense of the game’s screen output in a way that is at least similar to how humans or other intelligent animals are able to. Instead of considering each pixel independently, convolutional layers allow us to consider regions of an image, and maintain spatial relationships between the objects on the screen as we send information up to higher levels of the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Experience Replay\n",
    "\n",
    "The second major addition to make DQNs work is Experience Replay. \n",
    "\n",
    "The problem with online learning is that the *samples arrive in order* they are experienced and as such are highly correlated. Because of this, our network will most likely overfit and fail to generalize properly.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key idea of **experience replay** is that we store these transitions in our memory and during each learning step, sample a random batch and perform a gradient descend on it. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Experience Replay buffer stores a fixed number of recent memories, and as new ones come in, old ones are removed. When the time comes to train, we simply draw a uniform batch of random memories from the buffer, and train our network with them. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Separate Target Network\n",
    "\n",
    "This second network is used to generate the $Q$-target values that will be used to compute the loss for every action during training. \n",
    "\n",
    "The issue is that at every step of training, the $Q$-network’s values shift, and if we are using a constantly shifting set of values to adjust our network values, then the value estimations can easily spiral out of control. The network can become destabilized by falling into feedback loops between the target and estimated $Q$-values. In order to mitigate that risk, the target network’s weights are fixed, and only periodically or slowly updated to the primary $Q$-networks values. In this way training can proceed in a more stable manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of updating the target network periodically and all at once, we will be updating it frequently, but slowly."
